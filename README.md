## Prerequisites
* **[XIVLauncher](https://github.com/goatcorp/FFXIVQuickLauncher "XIVLauncher")**
* **[Plugin Penumbra](https://github.com/xivdev/Penumbra "Plugin Penumbra")**

## Description
This compilation of mods aims to embellish a little FINAL FANTASY XIV.

* **HD Items Icons** :
Replaces almost all the icons in the game by the one available on the Lodestone (FFXIV 5.41).
Therefore this excludes key objects for example.

* **HD Skills Icons** :
Replaces all action, skill, trait icons (FFXIV 5.25).

* **HD Buffs Icons** :
Replaces all buff / debuff icons (FFXIV 5.25).

* **HD Gear Set** :
Replaces the Gear Set icons with HD and colorful versions (colors corresponding to class / job types)

* **HD Macro Icons** :
Replace the macro icons with HD versions of this one.

* **HUD Revamp** : 
An extremely anticipated version of a "cleaner" interface for the game.

## Why this project?

Because ? ^^"  
No, more seriously, the idea came to me to test if replacing the icons of the game was possible when one of the first version of TexTools was released.  

Having a clear tendency to enlarge certain interface elements beyond 100% (or leave them at 100%) I could only see the rendering far below what the game was able to render for the icons.  

Also being able to see on my husband's screen that some icons were clearly "disgusting" (the fault of the compression of the files, not the artists who created them).  

This gave me the impetus to embark on this terribly long and sometimes laborious task (Special mention for the change of the indexes of the icons from one update to another ... I was delighted! ><).

## Why migrate to Penumbra?
The reason is simple, and if you know my project from the beginning on Nexus and XIX Mod Archive you might remember it.  

The problem of the installation lasting an eternity having been solved, this is no longer the problem ...  
But this is because TexTools, for such a mass of files can very quickly create an unnamed mess in the index files of the game because it alters them (especially with each update of the game ...).  

What Penumbra does not do at any time.  
Installing a mod can be done on the fly and the game files will not be corrupted.  

So yes, if in order to avoid being held responsible for something wrong with someone's game files I have to lose hardcore software users.  

I do it without hesitation.  

(and yes, I prefer ease of use rather than "first come" in the field ...)
## Help?!
All help is welcome!  
Not having the knowledge for, if anyone knows of a way to efficiently retrieve Lodestone icons with the corresponding id I would be immensely grateful. ♥
